# Smart Invoice Approval Agent MVP - Product Requirements Document

## Product Overview

An AI-powered invoice approval system with **persistent business memory** that learns vendor relationships, seasonal patterns, and business context over time to make intelligent decisions - going far beyond static rule-based automation.

**Core Innovation**: While existing tools follow rules, our agent understands business context and learns from every interaction to become smarter over time.

## Success Metrics

- **Primary**: 70% reduction in approval time for routine invoices vs manual process
- **Secondary**: 95% accuracy in contextual decision-making after 3 months of learning
- **Tertiary**: 90% user satisfaction ("feels like having a smart assistant who remembers everything")

## Competitive Advantage

## Core User Flows

### Flow 1: Invoice Submission

1. User uploads invoice (PDF/image) or forwards email
2. AI extracts vendor, amount, description, due date using GPT-5 Vision
3. **Memory Check**: AI reviews vendor history, business context, related discussions
4. System shows extracted data + contextual insights for confirmation
5. User submits for processing

### Flow 2: Intelligent Decision Making

1. AI analyzes **full business context**:
   - Vendor relationship history
   - Seasonal spending patterns
   - Recent business discussions (Slack/email)
   - Approver behavior patterns
   - Similar past decisions
2. Makes decision with **business reasoning**
3. Displays context: "Auto-approving: DataDog's standard monthly charge, consistent with 8-month pattern. John historically approves these within 2 hours."
4. Routes with full context or flags for manual review

### Flow 3: Approval with Learning

1. Approver receives notification with **complete business context**
2. Shows AI reasoning + vendor history + related business context
3. One-click approve/reject with optional feedback
4. **System learns**: Updates patterns, preferences, and business understanding

### Flow 4: Cross-System Context Integration

1. AI monitors connected systems (Slack, email, calendar) for relevant context
2. Builds persistent knowledge graph of business relationships
3. Applies context to future decisions automatically

## Database Schema

```sql
-- Core business entities
invoices (
  id, vendor_name, amount, description, due_date,
  file_url, extracted_data, business_context,
  decision_reasoning, status, created_at
)

approvers (
  id, name, email, role, approval_patterns,
  preferences, availability_patterns
)

vendor_relationships (
  id, vendor_name, typical_approver_id,
  seasonal_patterns, approval_history,
  business_context, relationship_strength
)

business_memory (
  id, context_type, content, embeddings,
  related_entities, importance_score, created_at
)

decisions (
  id, invoice_id, decision_type, reasoning,
  confidence_score, outcome, learning_feedback
)

integrations (
  id, platform, access_tokens, sync_status,
  last_sync, context_extracted
)
```

## AI Decision Engine Logic

### 1. Context Gathering

```javascript
// Gather all relevant business context
const context = await gatherContext({
  vendor: invoice.vendor_name,
  timeframe: "last_6_months",
  systems: ["slack", "email", "calendar"],
  approvers: getAllApprovers(),
});
```

### 2. Pattern Analysis

```javascript
// Analyze historical patterns
const patterns = await analyzePatterns({
  vendor_history: getVendorHistory(vendor),
  seasonal_trends: getSeasonalData(),
  approver_behavior: getApproverPatterns(),
  business_context: getBusinessContext(),
});
```

### 3. Intelligent Decision

```javascript
// Make contextually-aware decision
const decision = await makeDecision({
  invoice_data: extractedData,
  business_context: context,
  historical_patterns: patterns,
  confidence_threshold: 0.85,
});
```

### 4. Learning Loop

```javascript
// Learn from every decision
await updateMemory({
  decision: decision,
  outcome: actualOutcome,
  feedback: userFeedback,
  business_impact: measureImpact(),
});
```

### Key Demo Moments:

1. **"Watch it learn"**: Same vendor invoice routed differently as system learns preferences
2. **"Business context awareness"**: Unusual invoice approved because AI found related Slack discussion
3. **"Predictive intelligence"**: System suggests process improvements based on learned patterns

## Technical Constraints & Targets

- **AI Cost Budget**: <$200/month for MVP (GPT-5 premium pricing)
- **Response Latency**: <5 seconds for decision-making
- **OCR Accuracy**: >95% for standard business invoices
- **Learning Accuracy**: >90% decision accuracy after 50 examples per vendor
- **Scale Target**: 500 invoices/month with sub-second memory queries

## Risk Mitigation

| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **GPT-5 API Issues**     | Fallback to GPT-4 with degraded performance        |
| **Integration Failures** | Graceful degradation to invoice-only processing    |
| **Learning Accuracy**    | Manual override with feedback loop for improvement |

| **System Downtime**      | Offline mode with sync-when-available              |

## Success Criteria for MVP

1. **Memory Persistence**: System remembers and applies context from Day 1 through Month 6
2. **Cross-System Intelligence**: Pulls relevant context from Slack/email to inform decisions
3. **Learning Demonstration**: Measurably improves decision accuracy over time
4. **Business Understanding**: Makes decisions that make sense to business users
5. **User Satisfaction**: Users prefer AI decisions over manual routing
